## Features

- Event-based. Control event flow: Prevent default, stop propagation, cancel events.
- Emitter-inspired. Emit event types and data, don't bother with creating `Event` instances.
- Type-safe.
- Convenience methods like `.emitAsPromise()` and `.emitAsGenerator()` to build more complex event-driven systems.
- Tiny. Performant? I hope.
